# Code Of Conduct

### This CoC is applicable to:
- Everyone
- Everywhere in this repository

### Code? Very simple:
- English only
- No curses
- No threats
- No verbal abuses
- That means no racist remarks
- No sexual remarks
- Don't quarrel or be a cause of it, coding cannot be the cause of a quarrel (arguing is different).

### Report
- Using `Report` option in GitHub comment
- Or report at <a href="mailto:peter2003smith@gmail.com">peter2003smith@gmail.com</a> about the trouble maker with the GitHub ID.

### How they are dealt with
A decision against the trouble maker will be taken by those who have a clean record.
